To run the program you need to be in a python enironment 
To create a python environment use: 
Python3 -m -venv (Name) // Name can be changed to any environment name

To start the environment with:
source (Name)/bin/activate

Install required modules from the "requirement.txt" file with:
Pip install -r requirement.txt

Then run the program with:
Python3 version2.py 

To select other images change the path to "img".
To search for different object change the "input_object". See list for the documentation of object to number. (input_object has to end with a period (.) to be able to run correctly)

Common issues:
Make sure the file paths are correct.
